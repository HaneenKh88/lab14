Documintation:

1-  I create a `lab14` database: `CREATE DATABASE lab14;`

2- (psql -f /data/schema.sql -d lab14)  new database from the terminal prompt: `psql -f /data/schema.sql -d lab14` to connect the schema with database.

3- added the rows to lab14: `psql -f /data/seed.sql -d lab14`.
Restart PSQL and switch to `lab14.

4- create a copy of the database with the following command:
`CREATE DATABASE lab14_normal WITH TEMPLATE lab14;`



Query 1: CREATE TABLE AUTHORS (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255));

<!-- This query will create a second table in the lab14_normal database named authors. Confirm the success of this command by typing \d authors in your SQL shell. You should see the authors table schema, as shown above. -->

Query 2: INSERT INTO authors(name) SELECT DISTINCT author FROM books;

<!-- This query will use a simple subquery to retrieve unique author values from the books table and insert each one into the authors table in the name column. This is a great pattern for copying lots of data between tables. -->

Query 3: ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN author_id INT;

<!-- This query will add a column to the books table named author_id. This will connect each book to a specific author in the other table. -->

Query 4: UPDATE books SET author_id=author.id FROM (SELECT * FROM authors) AS author WHERE books.author = author.name;

<!-- This query will prepare a connection between the two tables. It works by running a subquery for every row in the books table. The subquery finds the author row that has a name matching the current book's author value. The id of that author row is then set as the value of the author_id -->

Query 5: ALTER TABLE books DROP COLUMN author;

<!-- This query will modify the books table by removing the column named author. Now that the books table contains a author_id column which will become a foreign key, your table does not need to contain a string representing each author. -->

Query 6: ALTER TABLE books ADD CONSTRAINT fk_authors FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors(id);

<!-- This query will modify the data type of the author_id in the books table, setting it as a foreign key which references the primary key in the authors table. Now PostgreSQL knows HOW these 2 tables are connected. -->
